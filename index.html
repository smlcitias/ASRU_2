			<h2>Reviewing In a Nutshell</h2>
			<p>
				Each paper that is accepted should be technically sound and make a contribution to the field. Look for
				what is good or stimulating in the paper, and what knowledge advancement it has made. We recommend that
				you embrace novel, brave concepts, even if they have not been tested on many datasets. For example, the
				fact that a proposed method does not exceed the state-of-the-art accuracy on an existing benchmark
				dataset is not grounds for rejection by itself. Rather, it is important to weigh both the novelty and
				potential impact of the work alongside the reported performance. Minor flaws that can be easily
				corrected should not be a reason to reject a paper. Above all, you should be specific and detailed in
				your reviews. Your discussion, more than your score, will help the authors, fellow reviewers, and Area
				Chairs understand the basis for your recommendation. You should include specific feedback on ways the
				authors can improve their papers.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Check your papers</b><BR />

				As soon as you get your reviewing assignment, please go through all the papers to make sure that (a) you
				have no obvious conflict of interest (see "Avoid Conflicts of Interest" below) and (b) you feel
				comfortable reviewing the paper assigned. If issues with either of these points arise, please contact
				the Area Chair right away as instructed in the detailed emails you will receive during the process.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Know the policies</b><BR />

				Please read the Author Guidelines carefully to familiarize yourself with all official policies the
				authors are expected to follow. If you come to believe that a paper may be in violation of any of these
				policies, please contact the Chairs. In the meantime, proceed to review the paper assuming no violation
				has taken place.
			</p>
			<h2>Ethics for Reviewing Papers</h2>
			<p>
				<b>1. Respect anonymity in the review process</b><BR />

				Our Author Guidelines have instructed authors to make reasonable efforts to hide their identities,
				including omitting their names, affiliations, and acknowledgments. This information will of course be
				included in the final published version of the manuscript. Reviewers should not take active steps to
				discover the identity of the authors, and make all efforts to keep their own identity invisible to the
				authors.
				With the increase in popularity of arXiv preprints, sometimes the authors of a paper may already be
				known to the reviewer. Posting to arXiv is NOT considered a violation of anonymity on the part of the
				authors, and in most cases, reviewers who happen to know (or suspect) the authors' identity can still
				review the paper as long as they feel that they can do an impartial job. An important general principle
				is to make every effort to treat papers fairly whether or not you know (or suspect) who wrote them. If
				you do not know the identity of the authors at the start of the process, DO NOT attempt to find it out
				by searching the Web for preprints.

				you do not know the identity of the authors at the start of the process, DO NOT attempt to find it out
				by searching the Web for preprints.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. Protect Ideas<BR />

				As a reviewer for CVPR, you have the responsibility to protect the confidentiality of the ideas
				represented in the papers you review. CVPR submissions are not published documents. The work is
				considered new or proprietary by the authors; otherwise they would not have submitted it. Of course,
				their intent is to ultimately publish to the world, but most of the submitted papers will not appear in
				the CVPR proceedings. Thus, it is likely that the paper you have in your hands will be refined further
				and submitted to some other journal or conference. Sometimes the work is still considered confidential
				by the authors' employers. These organizations do not consider sending a paper to CVPR for review to
				constitute a public disclosure. Protection of the ideas in the papers you receive means:
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
				<li>You should not show the paper to anyone else, including colleagues or students, unless you have
					asked them to write a review, or to help with your review.</li>
				<li>You should not show any results, videos/images, code or any of the supplementary material to
					non-reviewers.</li>
				<li>You should not use ideas/code from papers you review to develop your own ideas/code.</li>
				<li>After the review process, you should destroy all copies of papers and supplementary material and
					erase any code that the authors submitted as part of the supplementary, and any implementations you
					have written to evaluate the ideas in the papers, as well as any results of those implementations.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>3. Avoid Conflicts of Interest</b><BR />

				As a reviewer of a CVPR paper, it is important for you to avoid any conflict of interest. There should
				be absolutely no question about the impartiality of any review. Thus, if you are assigned a paper where
				your review would create a possible conflict of interest, you should return the paper and not submit a
				review. Conflicts of interest include (but are not limited to) situations in which:
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
				<li>You work at the same institution as one of the authors.</li>
				<li>You have been directly involved in the work and will be receiving credit in some way. If you're a
					member of an author's thesis committee, and the paper is about his or her thesis work, then you were
					involved.</li>
				<li>You suspect that others might perceive a conflict of interest in your involvement.</li>
				<li>You have collaborated with one of the authors in the past three years (more or less). Collaboration
					is usually defined as having written a paper or grant proposal together, although you should use
					your judgment.
				</li>
				<li>You were the MS/PhD advisor or advisee of one of the authors. Most funding agencies and publications
					typically consider advisees to represent a lifetime conflict of interest. CVPR has traditionally
					been more flexible than this, but you should think carefully before reviewing a paper you know to be
					written by a former advisor or advisee, especially a recent one.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				While the organizers make every effort to avoid such conflicts in the review assignments, they may
				nonetheless occasionally arise. If you recognize the work or the author and feel it could present a
				conflict of interest, contact the Area Chair as soon as possible so they can find someone else to review
				it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>4. Be Professional</b><BR />

				Belittling or sarcastic comments have no place in the reviewing process. The most valuable comments in a
				review are those that help the authors understand the shortcomings of their work and how they might
				improve it. Write a courteous, informative, incisive, and helpful review that you would be proud to sign
				with your name (were it not anonymous).
			</p>
			<h2>How to Write Good Reviews</h2>
			<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
				<li>Take the time to write good reviews. Ideally, you should read a paper and then think about it over
					the course of several days before you write your review.</li>
				<li>Short reviews are unhelpful to authors, other reviewers, and Area Chairs. If you have agreed to
					review a paper, you should take enough time to write a thoughtful and detailed review. Bullet lists
					with one short sentence per bullet are NOT a detailed review.</li>
				<li>Be specific when you suggest that the writing needs to be improved. If there is a particular section
					that is unclear, point it out and give suggestions for how it can be clarified.</li>
				<li>Be specific about novelty. Claims in a review that the submitted work "has been done before" MUST be
					backed up with specific references and an explanation of how closely they are related. At the same
					time, for a positive review, be sure to summarize what novel aspects are most interesting in the
					Strengths section.</li>
				<li>Do not reject papers solely because they are missing citations or comparisons to prior work that has
					only been published without review (e.g., arXiv or technical reports). Refer to the FAQ below for
					more details on handling arXiv prior art.</li>
				<li>Do not give away your identity by asking the authors to cite several of your own papers.</li>
				<li>If you think the paper is out of scope for CVPR's subject areas, clearly explain why in the review.
					Then suggest other publication possibilities (journals, conferences, workshops) that would be a
					better match for the paper. However, unless the area mismatch is extreme, you should keep an open
					mind, because we want a diverse set of good papers at the conference.</li>
				<li>The tone of your review is important. A harshly written review will be resented by the authors,
					regardless of whether your criticisms are true. If you take care, it is always possible to word your
					review constructively while staying true to your thoughts about the paper.</li>
				<li>Avoid referring to the authors in the second person ("you"). It is best to avoid the term "the
					authors" as well, because you are reviewing their work and not the person. Instead, use the third
					person ("the paper"). Referring to the authors as "you" can be perceived as being confrontational,
					even though you may not mean it this way.</li>
				<li>Be generous about giving the authors new ideas for how they can improve their work. You might
					suggest a new technical tool that could help, a dataset that could be tried, an application area
					that might benefit from their work, or a way to generalize their idea to increase its impact.</li>
				<li>Please refer to the Ethics Guidelines and Suggested Practices for Authors page to find out how to
					handle a some specific issues that may arise.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, keep in mind that a thoughtful review not only benefits the authors, but also yourself. Your
				reviews are read by other reviewers and especially the Area Chairs, in addition to the authors. Unlike
				the authors, the Area Chairs know your identity. Being a helpful reviewer will generate good will
				towards you in the research community - and may even help you to win an Outstanding Reviewer award.
			</p>
			<h2>Reviewer FAQs</h2>
			<p>
				<em>Q. Is there a minimum number of papers I should accept or reject?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A. No. Each paper should be evaluated in its own right. If you feel that most of the papers assigned
				to you have value, you should accept them. It is unlikely that most papers are bad enough to justify
				rejecting them all. However, if that is the case, provide clear and very specific comments in each
				review. Do NOT assume that your stack of papers necessarily should have the same acceptance rate as
				the entire conference ultimately will.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Q. Can I review a paper I already saw on arXiv and hence know who the authors are?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A. In general, yes, unless you are conflicted with one of the authors. See next question below for
				guidelines.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Q. There are well-established conferences with a rigorous peer review process, like ICIP and ICASSP,
					that publish proceedings with four-page papers. Suppose that a reviewer identifies a prior ICASSP or
					ICIP paper that has substantial overlap with a CVPR submission. Should this ICASSP/ICIP paper not be
					considered a "previous publication" under the CVPR'23 Dual Submission policy?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A. If the prior paper is within four pages, the CVPR submission in question is not in violation of the
				Dual Submission policy and will not be administratively rejected. However, the reviewer still needs to
				use their judgment to determine whether the submission offers enough additional value to warrant
				acceptance at CVPR. If it does not add enough value over prior work, it can still be rejected on
				substantive, not on policy, grounds. Additionally, depending on the specifics of the case, it may be
				relevant whether the authors of the prior ICASSP/ICIP paper are the same or different from those of the
				current CVPR submission. If there is a significant possibility that the authors of the present
				submission might be different from those of the prior paper, in which case this could be an instance of
				plagiarism, then the reviewer should contact the AC to investigate this possibility.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Q. Should authors be expected to cite related arXiv papers or compare to their results?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A. Consistent with good academic practice, the authors should cite all sources that inspired and
				informed their work. This said, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work with arXiv reports that
				appeared shortly before the submission deadline imposes an unreasonable burden. We also do not wish to
				discourage the publication of similar ideas that have been developed independently and concurrently.
				Reviewers should keep the following guidelines in mind:
				<br />
			<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
				<li>Authors are not required to discuss and compare their work with recent arXiv reports, although they
					should properly acknowledge those that directly and obviously inspired them.</li>
				<li>Failing to cite an arXiv paper or failing to beat its performance SHOULD NOT be SOLE grounds for
					rejection.</li>
				<li>Reviewers SHOULD NOT reject a paper solely because another paper with a similar idea has already
					appeared on arXiv. If the reviewer suspects plagiarism or academic dishonesty, they are encouraged
					to bring these concerns to the attention of the Program Chairs.
				</li>
				<li>It is acceptable for a reviewer to suggest that an author should acknowledge or be aware of
					something on arXiv.</li>

			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Q. How should I treat the supplementary material?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A. The supplementary material is intended to provide details of derivations and results that do not fit
				within the paper format or space limit. Ideally, the paper should indicate when to refer to the
				supplementary material, and you need to consult the supplementary material only if you think it is
				helpful in understanding the paper and its contribution. According to the Author Guidelines, the
				supplementary material MAY NOT include results obtained with an improved version of the method (e.g.,
				following additional parameter tuning or training), or an updated or corrected version of the submission
				PDF. If you find that the supplementary material violates these guidelines, please contact the Area
				Chair.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Q. Can I request additional experiments in the author's rebuttal? How should I treat additional
					experiments reported by authors in the rebuttal?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A. In your review, you may request clarifications or additional illustrations in the rebuttal. Per a
				passed 2018 PAMI-TC motion, reviewers should not request substantial additional experiments for the
				rebuttal, or penalize for lack of additional experiments. "Substantial" refers to what would be needed
				in a major revision of a paper. The rebuttal may include figures with illustrations or comparison tables
				of results reported in the submission/supplemental material or in other papers. However, papers should
				also not be penalized for supplying extra results; you can simply choose to ignore them.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Q. If a social media post shared information on a CVPR submission without the authors being
					involved, does that signal a violation?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A. No, it does not. A violation occurs only when authors are proactively doing so.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Q. A paper is using a withdrawn dataset, such as DukeMTMC-ReID or MS-Celeb-1M. How should I handle
					this?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A. Reviewers are advised that the choice to use a withdrawn dataset, while not in itself grounds for
				rejection, should invite very close scrutiny. Reviewers should flag such cases in the review form for
				further consideration by ACs and PCs. Consider questions such as: Do the authors explain why they had to
				do this? Is this explanation compelling? Is there really no alternative dataset that could have been
				used? Remember, authors might simply not know the dataset had been withdrawn. If you believe the paper
				could be accepted without the authors' use of a withdrawn dataset, then it is natural to advise the
				authors to remove the experiments associated with this dataset.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Q. If a paper did not evaluate on a withdrawn dataset, can I request authors that they do?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A. It is a violation of policy for a reviewer or Area Chair to require comparison on a dataset that has
				been withdrawn.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Q. A paper is claiming a dataset as one of its contributions. How should I evaluate this claim?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A. If a paper submission is claiming a dataset as one of its contributions, there should be a reasonable
				expectation that the dataset will be made publicly available upon publication. You should use your
				judgment to evaluate the dataset claim accordingly. Note that this does NOT imply that all datasets used
				in CVPR submissions must be public, or that papers relying on non-public datasets must be rejected. The
				use of private or otherwise restricted datasets (e.g. for training or experimentation) DOES NOT
				constitute grounds for rejection. However, private or otherwise restricted datasets cannot be claimed as
				contributions in their own right, and you must evaluate the papers based on their other technical
				merits.
