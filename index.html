			<h1>Preparation of the Paper</h1>
			<!-- Content Title -->
			<h2>Document Formatting</h2>
			<p>
				Use the following guidelines when preparing your document:
			</p>
			<p>
				LENGTH: You are allowed a total of <b>6 pages of content and figures, plus up to 2 pages containing only
					references</b>for your document. This is the maximum number of pages that will be accepted,
				including all
				figures, tables, and references. Any documents that exceed the 6-page content & figure limit, or which
				have content other than references on page 7 & 8, will be rejected.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>LANGUAGE</b>: All submissions must be in English.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>MARGINS</b>: Documents should be formatted for standard <b>letter-size (8-1/2" by 11" or 216mm by
					279mm)
					paper</b> A4-size is also acceptable. Any text or other material outside the margins specified below
				will
				not be accepted:
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
				<li>All text and figures must be contained in a 178 mm x 229 mm (7 inch x 9 inch) image area.</li>
				<li>The left margin must be 19 mm (0.75 inch).</li>
				<li>The top margin must be 25 mm (1.0 inch), except for the title page where it must be 35 mm (1.375
					inches).</li>
				<li>Text should appear in two columns, each 86 mm (3.39 inch) wide with 6 mm (0.24 inch) space between
					columns.</li>
				<li>On the first page, the top 50 mm (2") of both columns is reserved for the title, author(s), and
					affiliation(s). These items should be centered across both columns, starting at 35 mm (1.375 inches)
					from the top of the page.</li>
				<li>The paper abstract should appear at the top of the left-hand column of text, about 12 mm (0.5")
					below the title area and no more than 80 mm (3.125") in length. Leave 12 mm (0.5") of space between
					the end of the abstract and the beginning of the main text.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				A format sheet with the margins and placement guides is available in the following file formats:
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
				<li>PDF file (When you print this file, make sure the "shrink to fit" box is not checked!)</li>
				<li>TPostScript file</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>TYPE:</B>
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>Face</B>: To achieve the best viewing experience for the review process and conference proceedings,
				we strongly encourage authors to use Times-Roman or Computer Modern fonts. If a font face is used that
				is not recognized by the submission system, your submission will not be reproduced correctly.
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>Size</B>: Use a font size that is no smaller than 9 points throughout the paper, including figure
				captions. In 9-point type font, capital letters are 2 mm high. For 9-point type font, there should be no
				more than 3.2 lines/cm (8 lines/inch) vertically. This is a minimum spacing; 2.75 lines/cm (7
				lines/inch) will make the submission much more readable. Larger type sizes require correspondingly
				larger vertical spacing.
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>TITLE</B>: The paper title must appear in boldface letters and should be in ALL CAPITALS. Do not use
				LaTeX math notation ($x_y$) in the title; the title must be representable in the Unicode character set.
				Also try to avoid uncommon acronyms in the title.
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>AUTHOR LIST</B>: The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear below the title in capital and lower
				case letters. Submissions with multiple authors and affiliations may require two or more lines for this
				information. The order of the authors on the document should exactly match in number and order the
				authors typed into the online submission form. Do not include the author list on the blind version of
				the submission.
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>ABSTRACT</B>: Each paper should contain an abstract of approximately 100 to 150 words that appears at
				the beginning of the document. Use the same text that is submitted electronically along with the author
				contact information.
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>INDEX TERMS (KEYWORDS)</B>: Enter up to 5 keywords separated by commas.
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>BODY</B>: Major headings appear in boldface CAPITAL letters, centered in the column. Subheadings
				appear in capital and lower case, either underlined or in boldface. They start at the left margin of the
				column on a separate line. Sub-subheadings are discouraged, but if they must be used, they should appear
				in capital and lower case, and start at the left margin on a separate line. They may be underlined or in
				italics.
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>REFERENCES</B>: List and number all references at the end of the document. The references can be
				numbered in alphabetical order or in order of appearance in the paper. When referring to them in the
				text, type the corresponding reference number in square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence
				[1]. The end of the document should include a list of references containing information similar to the
				following example:
			</p>
			<p>
				[1] D. E. Ingalls, "Image Processing for Experts," IEEE Trans. ASSP, vol. ASSP-36, pp. 1932-1948, 1988.
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>ILLUSTRATIONS & COLOR</B>: Illustrations must appear within the designated margins. They may span the
				two columns. If possible, position illustrations at the top of columns, rather than in the middle or at
				the bottom. Caption and number every illustration. All halftone illustrations must be clear in black and
				white. Since the printed proceedings will be produced in black and white, be sure that your images are
				acceptable when printed in black and white (the electronic and IEEE Xplore proceedings will retain the
				colors in your document).
			</p>
			<p>
				PAGE NUMBERS: <B>Do not put page numbers on your document</B>. Appropriate page numbers will be added to
				accepted papers when the conference proceedings are assembled.
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>Templates</B>
			</p>
			<p>
				The following style files and templates are available for users of LaTeX and Microsoft Word:
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
				<li>LaTeX style file with margin, page layout, font, etc. definitions.</li>
				<li>BiBTeX style file with bibliography style definitions.</li>
				<li>REGULAR LaTeX template file, an example of using the "spconf.sty" and "IEEEbib.bst" files above.
				</li>
				<li>BLIND LaTeX template file, an example of using the "spconf.sty" and "IEEEbib.bst" files above.</li>
				<li>REGULAR PDF generated from the template file.</li>
				<li>BLIND PDF generated from the template file.</li>
				<li>Sample strings.bib and refs.bib files.</li>
				<li>Sample image1.pdf, image3.pdf and image4.pdf files, referenced in the LaTeX template.</li>
				<li>REGULAR Word 97/2000 Sample, a template of correct formatting and font use.</li>
				<li>BLIND Word 97/2000 Sample, a template of correct formatting and font use.</li>
				<li>All of the above files in a single ZIP File, tar.gz File, or 7z File.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				We recommend that you use the Word file or LaTeX files to produce your document, since they have been
				set up to meet the formatting guidelines listed above. When using these files, double-check the paper
				size in your page setup to make sure you are using the letter-size paper layout (8.5" X 11") or A4 paper
				layout (210mm X 297mm). The LaTeX environment files specify suitable margins, page layout, text, and a
				bibliography style.
			</p>
			<p>
				In particular, with LaTeX, there are cases where the top-margin of the resulting PDF file does not meet
				the specified parameters. In this case, you may need to add a \topmargin=0mm command just after the
				\begin{document} command in your .tex file. The spacing of the top margin is not critical, as the page
				contents will be adjusted on the proceedings. The critical dimensions are the actual width and height of
				the page content.
